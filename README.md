#WellStoried Demo
Gulp usage: 

```
// watch sass and build when changed
gulp stream

// compress js and move to dist
gulp uglify

// optimize images and move to disk
gulp images

// compile sass
gulp compass

//perform all tasks and move result to dist
gulp build
```

To do list given more time:

* Kerning on "Well Storied" seems off, don't have font to redo
* Play with animation effects for main circle
* Footer is true to design, but is hard to read
* In small screen responsive version, make circle fit as per design, would require some time/math to make work
* Image preloader for main background
